Capacitive Sensing
==================

This component has functions for capacitive sensing, and for interpreting
capacitive sensing data. At present they are all in a single module, with
an example app.

Pictures of the board are in the docs directory.

* module_capacitive_sensing: module that implements capacitive sensing functions

* app_example_capsens: Example application for an XK-1 that requires cap
  sense hardware to be attached to the northern connector (not the one next
  to the power supply)

Hardware schematics and other documentation to be added soon.
